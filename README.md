# Juno Project 7 - Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Description

My personal responsive portfolio website built with JavaScript. 

## Project objective

To show off all the skills I've learned in the bootcamp, especially HTML, CSS, and modern web standards. The point of this portfolio project is to showcase my development skills.

## Project Requirements

- It is required that I code an existing portfolio site design from Themeforest which can be purchased only in PSD. It must not have any HTML or CSS with it. I purchased the: [Hardy - Personal Portfolio PSD Template](https://themeforest.net/item/hardy-personal-portfolio-psd-template/25731500) theme.



Because I'm showing off my ability to code, I have to be sure to adhere to the best practices mentioned in class. Best practices include but may not be limited to:


-   The portfolio itself must be coded in plain HTML and CSS with jQuery or vanilla JavaScript for effects (i.e. my portfolio site CANNOT be React).
-   All images considered content have descriptive alt text.
-   Extraneous code is removed (including console.log).
-   Semantic HTML elements are used properly.
-   Setup snippet is used.
-   Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays.
-   Site is responsive and uses media queries.
